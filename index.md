## Kassandra Merino Muniz's Digital Portfolio
Welcome! This website hosts my a portfolio of my digital work. For my final project, I wanted to analyze the Art of Devastation dataset available on the American Numismatic Society's website. I was interested in analyzing how the images on the medallions commemorated the First World War. For example, what symbols they used, who was depicted on those medallions, etc. Listed below are the links to the jupyter notebook I used and the powerpoint. Feel free to expand and draw up your own conclusions from this data!

This link takes you to the jupyter notebook that I used for my analysis. [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kassandramerinomuniz/clas299/master?filepath=Devastation%2FAoDevastation.ipynb)
